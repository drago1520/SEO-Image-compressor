# Advanced SEO image optimizer
This project is intended for website owners and SEO agencies looking to improve their image SEO, which includes alt tags and small sizes without loosing quality.

The most common cause of slow website is slow server, many http requests and **large image size.** 





## Features

- Regulate compression level
- Choose your output image format (webp is preffered always)
- Write Bulgarian alt tag and have them transcribed and hyphenated in the image name (храна за кучета -> hrana-za-kucheta.png)
- Choose the output height and width
- Work in bulk
